      <description>Introduction # [!warning] Warning&#xA;This page was originally written in Fall 2021. It is likely outdated. Please ask your TA for the latest information!&#xA;I get asked a lot about whether I have any advice for doing well on 61A exams, so I thought it would be nice to type some of it out. The following is my opinion/experience only, so feel free to ignore some or all of it if something else is more effective for you!</description>
